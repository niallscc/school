Finished NPC Interaction, walk up to the vendor and click on him and press B. 
There is a bug where, unless you sell from last to first, you can't sell mutliple items because the indexes get changed when you sell an item.
So. So. Sick of this game.

Got basic NPC added, you can walk up to him (he's on the top of the board). Click on him and press B. Next just need to send a
Buy Event when a player clicks Buy Item(It's a little more complicated than that). Then add a Talk, Sell functionality.
