<div class=articles><p6><h3>Thoughtlife</h3><br>     Yes, I know what you are thinking the emery song right? well this blog doesnt really have a whole lot, if anything at all to do with that song, but more to do with a thought its self. I realize now as I write this that many of my ideas and notions come from movies, music and other media's but, I digress. A thought, not unlike an idea, has a life all unto its own. It has an inception, a birth, a life, and, in many cases, a death. If you remember the movie V for Vendetta, the thought of an Idea is the central theme in this move. I my own life however, I have not stumbled upon a great idea or some profound thought, but rather many small thoughts seem to wriggle their way into my mind and at times seem to want to take control. While this may seem like a funny concept for an idea, or thought taking control of your mind, seeing as how your mind was the thing that brought the idea into existence( again I digress), it feels many times that this is how it is. I recently experienced a funny thing where my thoughts, and memories one night almost took control of me to the point where I felt, as I would describe it, every emotion all at one time. I dont know if you have ever felt this before but I would say that  I have. It was unlike anything i had ever experienced before I was sad, happy, angry, and every emotion in between all in what seemed like one moment. it was here that i discovered how powerful a thought can be if taken out of context. This is partially why I write this blog to be able to let all these bottled up thoughts come out into one (mostly) cohesive stream that I can reflect upon in years to come, once again I digress. This brought me to the conclusion though that when these thoughts, feelings, emotions, etc. begin to infiltrate our minds we have two options(in my limited experience). Option 1: to succumb to the emotions. If we allow it our minds will gladly bring us to a place where we believe whatever has festered inside our minds to the point where we are blinded to the truth of the situation we find ourselves in.(yes this sounds much like the movie inception but I promise as I write this i am in no way referencing this movie, although it was very good and you should watch it if you have yet to.) or Option 2: to step away from the thoughts that are trying so hard to control us and look at the situation from a third party perspective and try to see what is really happening. While this is no easy task I feel that it is the only sure fire way to gain true understanding of what is happening in your mind. Once you are able to step away from whatever is going on in your life, many times you can make much better decisions on the situation at hand. 
<br><br> at this point you might be asking your self why you read this far into this post, and quite honestly I would be asking that same question if I were you, but to sum it all up the reason I am writing this is because I need to remember this myself, lately it seems that my mind has been trying to take control of me and my life. and I need to take a step back and remember what got me to this place and what it is going to take to get out of the place I am at, and this is the conclusion I have come to after much thought.<br><br> The only way for me to get back on the right track is to stop calling God Lord. While that may sound incredibly silly seeing as how God is the Lord of all creation I feel now that this needs to stop. Thanks to Mr. Webb's incredible teaching abilities I now see that I need to start referring to Him as Father, or Abba( daddy)<br> Let me break it down for you, I now see that the reason I am feeling many of the things I am feeling is because I have taken the love, forgiveness, and the relationship that Christ wanted to give me and thrown all that aside and gone back to the old testament way of worship which is where I now go to church, read my Bible, and pray so that I can check these things off my list of Christian things to do. This is because when you think of the title of Lord, that places God away from you in some far off place where you only have to do steps 1, 2, and 3 to be able to make Him happy and keep you happy. where as if I were to change my mentality to that of a father, son relationship which is much more intimate 
and what should be desired by Christians everywhere, at that point it is no longer this checklist but a desire and a chasing after of the Jesus because I believe when you have the father, son relationship, or even Husband, wife relationship that is talked about throughout the Bible, then you will truly be able to find Joy in every situation and life in the desert, so to speak. 
<br> 
This is a very long winded way to say that I realize I have been checking off items on my spiritual checklist for far to long. I need to remember why God paid the price that Is His son, so I can have a relationship with Him. not so I can debate theology, or try to figure out what predestination truly means for me or who the elect really are or try to understand why hell is eternal, I believe that all those questions will be answered in due time, but for now It is time to <br> Be still and know that He is God. <br><br> Peace.

It was a pretty cool experience, for those of you who have windows computers you can download the game we made from : <a href='http://www.subligaming.com/The%20Shrinking%20of%20Outlaw%20Bill.zip'>Here</a> 
Its called The Shrinking of Outlaw Bill :) <br> but before you run off to download it let me tell you a little bit about the competition. The idea of the NM Game Jam is that you have 48 hours to create a playable demo of a game. The competition was spread out over three locations, one in ABQ, one in Santa Fe and one at NM tech. It was an awesome experience and my co-creators were awesome. In our team it was me, and Ryan Leonski as programmers, and Shandiin, and Bryan(im sorry I dont know their last names) as graphic designers. We worked really hard on the game and we dont know how we placed yet but Ill update this post as I know what happened. 
<br>Peace!

This was a very novel concept to me because I had always thought of relationships as something living and breathing yes, but not something that can die.<br>With this in mind I thought it a good idea to write an obituary of my own. <br><br>The Death of Nialls Christian Chavez and Anna Maria Rebecca Fernandez. <br>Nialls and Anna had a relatively long life together with their birth as a couple being August 22, 2008 at 1:06:36 am and their death being on July 27th 2010 at about 3 in the afternoon. While their death is marked by this day in particular, the decay process did not occur on this date, no, the cancer that ate through their relationship was a slow moving cancer that consumed the couple from the inside out. It began with the malnourished relationship that the couple had with their savior Jesus. They started out very healthy with a strong love for Jesus and the desire to push forward His kingdom, but in the later days of their relationship, that once strong cord that had so tightly held them together through all the ups and downs of a companionship had become brittle due to a lack of oneness and drive to seek the kingdom of God above everything else. Once their relationship with Christ had become very brittle, almost to the point of breaking, the couple tried on their own to remedy the situation with everything but the one thing that could have saved them. They tried quality time, recreational activities, and spending time with friends, but all to no avail. They failed to try the only remedy that could have saved them. Jesus. At this point, one would think that immediate medical attention would be required and would be quickly administered, but the couple was so engulfed in themselves that, to a degree, they began to ignore the disease that was slowly eating them away. While the couple was able to deny the existence of a cancer for a short while, the cancer finally came out into the open and reared its despicable head on July 27th 2010 when it took hold of the relationship and finally brought it to an end.<br>While this cause of death may be debated by some and some would say that the cause of death is tied to the certain arguments that the couple had and a lack of communication on their parts, I disagree. I believe that when a couple focuses on only the Lord and doing His will then everything else will fall into place. Communication will begin to fix its self and the cancer will go into remission. 
<br> 
Although the death of a relationship is something to be mourned, the life and experiences that were shared by the couple will not be forgotten by either party, while their relationship had its high points and low points, I believe that neither one would give up any of it for the world. Much was learned from that relationship, and that is not something that will be quickly forgotten. The love that was shared through the life of this couple will always be something that is cherished for many years to come. 
<br> In the end God is the only one in control and I look forward to the day where in heaven all relationships are mended and the cancer that eats through relationships, and through individuals, will be eradicated eternally and we will live in the grace and love of Christ Jesus Forever. 
<br>peace.

Well, here are the pictures from the camping/backpacking trip me and my best friend Clay Church took. It was pretty amazing I must admit. We went up into the Pecos (which is right outside of Santa Fe) 
and Thursday, Friday, and Saturday we just camped at the normal camping area up there with my Family and Rachel Schilling, then Sunday me and Clay left to go on our intense backpacking trip. I must admit it was
the most strenuous, intense hike I have ever been on climbing up to the top of that dang mountain, but after 5ish hours of hiking through the wilderness it was the most satisfying feeling to make it to the lake(lake Pecos
baldy) and we were pretty much overwhelmed with a sense of accomplishment on making it to our destination. Once we were there, we ate, then slept. The next day we decided to hike up to the top of the Pecos Baldy 
peak (that is where the last picture is taken from). and upon making it up to the top of that mountain and looking out over, what felt like the whole world, was the most amazing feeling ever and it was pretty epic
because we rolled huge bolders off the top of the mountain. Dont worry no one was down at the bottom but it was pretty ballin! once we made it down the mountain, We made the horrible choice to try to make it 
to Pecos Baldy Falls. We were unsuccessful. After three hours of hiking almost straight down the side of a mountain we finally made it to the halfway point to the falls. By this time it was about 3 o'clock and we made the
decision to go back and save ourselves from making it there then dying on the way back. Keep in mind that the saying "what goes up must come down" well flip that around and we quickly realized that the climb back
up the mountain was much harder than getting down it, and that difficulty was compounded by the fact that we only brought one bottle of water with us. Not the greatest Idea we have ever had, and we have had
a lot of bad ideas. When we got back to the campsite, happy to be alive, we ate then crashed out but not before making the most awesom-est fire ever! yes me and clay were smart enough to get a fire started, with 
a little help of gasoline of course. The next day we headed back home(tuesday) ready to take a shower and sleep! 
<br> 
And with that, our camping trip came to an end. It was quite possibly one of the most amazing things I have ever done and I cant wait to do it again! 
Peace!

<p2><h3>Hero</h3> 
Well for any of you who have started reading this blog and are wondering about what is going on in my life, well right now has not been the greatest time in my life ever. Me and my girlfriend of two years just broke up last week, which was not a good time. That being said we both knew that it needed to happen and it happened on as good of terms as it could have. Though, while all this is happening, all I can think of is that song by Regina Spektor, hero. It plays in the movie 500 days of summer when the main character is walking up a staircase to see the girl he is in love with. During this scene the camera splits in two and you see what he thinks is going to happen and what is actually happening. On one side you see him come up the stairs see the girl and they embrace and it is the perfect moment, while in reality he goes upstairs( SPOILER ALERT:if you haven't seen the movie don't read this part) he sees her with another guy and she has a wedding ring on. You see him leave and he is completely distraught. This is a lot like how the last moments of our relationship was. I went in to our final conversation thinking that everything was ok and that this was the girl I was going to marry when in all actuality it ended very abruptly... 
<br> 
I am the hero of this story I don't need to be saved.
<br> <br> 
while the correlation to this song may not make too much sense to anyone else if you watch the movie the song just hits the spot right on. And in all the craziness of this time and what is going on I guess I needed an avenue to express myself and that is where this blog comes in. I promise it won't be as melancholy as it is right now but I needed to vent somehow. So now that you know a little about what is going on in my life, its time to move on and know that no matter what God is in control of all things and He has a plan for my life and hers. 
<br>Through all of this, it seems that I have learned some very valuable lesions in life and what to do in situations like this. The important thing to remember is this: No matter what, there is always a light at the end of the tunnel and there is always someone waiting there for you, secondly, it is important to remember that this life is by its very nature finite and nothing in life really lasts, and I hold on to the hope that one day all relationships will be mended and made new in Heaven. 
 
so there ya go, the DL on my life up to the moment. 
 
Peace!<br><!-- <h4>Comments</h4>
