BUGS.txt	


This is the Bugs.txt File for P2 M2. 

 FYI, the bugs in this program are extensive.

1.
	There is no JUnit test file for grellSim or its classes

2.	
	GrellSim doesn't even workâ€¦.
	The main problem, as far as I can see, is in GrellSim in the main 
	loop. Here, it is not returning the correct order to the world, 
	so the acknowledge order isn't working correctly. 
	
3. 
	Miscellaneous bugs, I have not had time to go back and check 
	to see if all the variables that need to be private final 
	are as such, so the principle of least privilege is not being 
	implemented here properly. 

4.
	Documentation is not done. Because my program isn't working, there 	no documentation for this program.
