BUGS

This is the bugs file for the final rollout of GrellSim 
By Nialls Chavez

1. Different assignment policies are buggy. I know Round robin works
   because I have been testing that one a lot. but the other ones, 
   not so much. they should work but have not been tested throughly
   enough to vouch for their validity.

2. Change orders and Cancelations, This functionality is buggy at best
   and broken at worst. I realized this was a bug way to late in the 
   development process to fix it accurately.

3. number of assembly lines. For some reason it works fine with 1 assembly        
   line but not with more than one. it has to do with how it is popping 
   off the queue. something is broken in GrellFindableQueue. 

3. GrellFindableQueue. Didn't know it was broken til' it was too late. 
   I didn't get feedback on its validity and assumed it was working 
   until I found that this is the root of many of my problems
   particularly the pop method

4. Miscellaneous. I am sure there are other bugs floating around I didn't 
   catch and this is to account for those and let you know that I know 
   they are there. One thing to note is that Sometimes, even on default 
   settings you will get stuck in an infinite loop or get a null pointer
   exception.. I don't know why but you doâ€¦ 
   
5. Side note. I am not submitting a runnable jar because there are bugs that might cause 
   an infinite loop, therefore, it is best not to have a runnable jar 
   destroying things when you can run from Eclipse and have the power
   to kill it if anything happens.
