ReadMe File for CS362 Homework 2 
Problem 6.10
and 
Problem 6.8

To run this file with different inputs, all you need to do is change the two arrays that are
created at the top of this java file. with different inputs you will get different outputs. For problem 6.8 specifically 
you can also change the f(j) function to reflect whatever incremental input you want. 
If you have any questions please email me ASAP at niallsc@gmail.com


Test runs of Problem 6.8
	On input 
	
		int[] tempArray= {1,1,5,3 };
		with f(j) being {2,3,5,7};
		
	Output is: 
		The max number of robots destroyed is: 5

	On input 
	
		int[] tempArray= {1,1,1,1 };
		with f(j) being {2,3,5,7};
		
	Output is: 
		The max number of robots destroyed is: 4

	On input 
	
		int[] tempArray= {1,1,1,7 };
		with f(j) being {2,3,5,7};
		
	Output is: 
		The max number of robots destroyed is: 7
	
Test runs of problem 6.10

	On input
			int[] tempCompA={20, 1, 20, 20};
			int[] tempCompB= {15, 1, 21, 1};
	Output is: 
			The most computation time you can get is:61
			
	On input
			int[] tempCompA={20, 1, 20, 20};
			int[] tempCompB= {15, 1, 21, 24};
	Output is: 
			The most computation time you can get is:65
		
	On input
			int[] tempCompA={20, 1, 20, 27};
			int[] tempCompB= {15, 1, 21, 24};
	Output is: 
			The most computation time you can get is:68
