Bugs for April 7th, 2012:
Web_Final Revision 491

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Bug Description:  This one is less of a bug and more something that probably 
shouldn't be possible. I am able to delete the header, body and footer 
(template tab only).

Status:  Being worked on at 3:14pm on April 10th.

PRE-TURN-IN EDIT:  Fixed when checked on May 7th.

Steps To Reproduce:  Select the header, body, or footer, press escape, click OK.

Implications:  If you do this to the template, you will have an unusable project.

Possible Fixes:  Either disable the deletion of the header, body or footer 
canvases or allow users to add them back if they really don't want the one of the
three. 

Implemented Fix:  Please update.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Bug Description:  When you try to delete a text item, the text disappears from
the selection box, but the box itself doesn't disappear and you can still right 
click it to edit the text that was there.

EDIT using Revision 502:  You can also delete the contents of a Div and have the 
selection box linger.  When you delete a Div with its own children, the children
go away, and the selection box seems to disappear, but you can still select the 
parent.

Status:  Being worked on at 3:14pm on April 10th.

PRE-TURN-IN EDIT: Text boxes no longer exist, so this bug no longer exists. 

Steps To Reproduce:  Create a text item, select it, right click inside its box, 
submit text, and with the item still selected, press escape to delete, click OK,
right click the text selection box again, observe editor with deleted text, 
and submit the text again to see that nothing happens.

Steps To Reproduce r502:  Create Div, change its background color to make it 
visible, create a Div inside the Div, change its background color, create a 
third Div in that Div and make the same change, then delete the first Div, 
select the first Div, try to make a background color change and realize the
selection box is all that remains. 

Implications:  With this, there will be a bunch of selection boxes lying around
all over if you decide to delete anything on the header, body, or footer.

Possible Fixes: Please update.

Implemented Fix: Text boxes done away with.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Bug Description:  When you try to delete anything and click cancel, you see:
 'Exception thrown and not caught'     
 in http://127.0.0.1:8888/web_final/sc/modules/ISC_Core.js     at line 301

Status:  Fixed when last checked at 3:15pm on April 10th.

Steps To Reproduce:  Select something, press escape, and click cancel.

Implications:  The user will get an unfriendly message.

Possible Fixes: Please update.

Implemented Fix: Please update.

Bugs for April 9th, 2012
Web_Final Revision 502

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Bug Description:  Creating a Div and adding media to it disables its deletion.
I can't delete media either, so I think the media is what is preventing me from 
deleting the Div. 

Status:  Unresolved as of 12:47am

PRE-TURN-IN EDIT: Unable to embed a YouTube video on May 7th.

Steps To Reproduce: Create a Div, set its background color to make it visible,
add media to the Div, select the parent Div, try and fail to delete the parent 
Div, and try and fail to delete the media. 

Implications: You can create Divs that you cannnot delete, but you can undo.

Possible Fixes: Please update.

Implemented Fix: Please update.

Bugs for April 10th, 2012
Web_Final Hosted Revision 525

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Bug Description:  All css styles normally seen in the editor are not showing up
on the hosted version of Web_Final.

Status:  Unresolved as of 2:12pm

PRE-TURN-IN EDIT: Fixed when checked on May 7th.

Steps To Reproduce: Create a navigational menu and see that it is only a series 
of links to the created pages. 

Implications:  Its not very pretty.

Possible Fixes: Please update.

Implemented Fix: Please update.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Bug Description:  When creating a new tab, multi-word tab names are concatenated
in the menu.

Status:  Unresolved as of 2:34pm

PRE-TURN-IN EDIT:  This is by design.  We shouldn't have multiple word tab names.

Steps To Reproduce: Create a new tab, enter a name with multiple words, submit
that name, see that it is concatenated in the tab, create a navigational menu,
see that the name is still concatenated in the menu.

Implications:  You cannot create menu options which are two or more words and 
have the words separated by spaces.

Possible Fixes: Please update.

Implemented Fix: Please update.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Bug Description:  Template changes are not recognized when you save a project
and reload it.

Status:  Unresolved as of 2:53pm

PRE-TURN-IN EDIT: Fixed when checked on May 7th.

Steps To Reproduce: Add something like a navigational menu to the template, click
save, log out, log in, and see that the changes to the template page are not there 
anymore. 

Implications:  Templates cannot be used in a project because they won't save.

Possible Fixes: Please update.

Implemented Fix: Please update.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Bug Description:  Tabs will change order (i.e. index tab will now show up after
Blogs tab) when you log in or reload your project.

Status:  Unresolved as of 3:55pm

PRE-TURN-IN EDIT: This still happens, but inconsistently.  It worked properly the 
first time I reloaded, but not the second time.  Checked on May 7th.

Steps To Reproduce: Add something like a navigational menu to the template, click
save, log out, log in, and see that the changes to the template page are not there 
anymore. 

Implications:  Templates cannot be used in a project because they won't save.

Possible Fixes: Please update.

Implemented Fix: Please update.

PRE-TURN-IN EDIT: Fixed when checked on May 7th.

Bug Description:  Borders extend canvas beyond selection.

Status:  Unresolved as of 12:54am

PRE-TURN-IN EDIT: This is an issue with CSS and not something we found a hack for.

Steps To Reproduce: Create div in canvas, select div, modify border to be at
least 10px(just a recommendation to see the issue), click submit, and see that the 
div has extended past its selection marquee.

Implications:  If you change the border of the head, body, or footer canvas, the
canvas will extend beyond the view of the user.
.

Possible Fixes: Offset selection based on the border width value.

Implemented Fix: Please update.

Bugs for May 7th, 2012

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Bug Description:  When you make an invalid phone number, email, or password and 
when you don't input matching passwords in signup, the warning pops up and then 
the "Submit" button is permanently disabled until you reload the page or click 
to a new tab and back to Sign Up.

Status:  Found on April 27th.  Fixed when checked on May 7th.

Steps To Reproduce: You can just hit submit immediately upon seeing the forms 
for Sign Up to see this.

Implications:  It's irritating and could confuse users.

Possible Fixes: Please update.

Implemented Fix: Please update.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Bug Description:  The RichTextEditor has the same issues that the tooltips have 
in the live, where the text in the drop down menus can be hard to see over the 
text in the editor.  I know that RichTextEditor is a part of Smart GWT and this 
is likely only in the live version, but it is quite troublesome.

Status:  Found on April 27th.  Fixed when checked on May 7th. Tooltips also have
opaque backing now.

Steps To Reproduce: Select the header, body, or footer, click to add text, type 
something into the editor until the text is under the font size drop down, select 
the text, change the size of the text to 36pt,  and you should see the problem if 
you use the drop down menu again if you didn't while you were changing the size 
initially.

Implications:  It's irritating and not easy on the eyes.

Possible Fixes: Please update.

Implemented Fix: Please update.
