/********Independent Project*******/

This file serves as the main go-to for all things related to our final project
for complex adaptive systems. This turnin consists of 3 folders and our report

animations/ 

This folder contains the videos we generated for our project. Each mp4 file 
contains a visualization of different types of runs of our Project. These videos
were generated using matplotlib's animations library. This library is kind of hard
to use and requires a lot of playing with to get to work. Therefore the runs set up
are not intended to be used for generating these videos, however it is totally 
possible to do so. 

data/

The data folder holds information used to generate our graphs and do analysis on 
how the CA is performing under different conditions. The first number in the name 
corresponds to the amount of time a tree is able to burn for and the second is the 
amount of time a grass cell is able to burn for. 

code_indiv_runs/ 

This contains the code that we used for our presentation. each of these are tailored
to different types of runs so that we could quickly demonstrate our project in class.

Project3.py

This file is meant to be run using Python 2.7 It will probably not run on the CS machines
due to my use of enums in this file. However if you feel like running it on your personal
machine it should work just fine if you install the necesary packages. 

Project3_CS_Machines.py


This file is pretty much a duplicate of the other project3.py file except I removed the use
of ENUMs and it can be run on the CS boxes.
