Back Story:


This game is set in the medieval ages during a Zombie Apocalypse that was brought on by a strand of the black plague that caused the corpse's who were infected by the black plague to come back to life after their painful demise. You play as one of the few survivors of the apocalypse who are trying to fight their way out of medieval England to the port city of Dover  to escape into the New World to live a new life without the Plague.
